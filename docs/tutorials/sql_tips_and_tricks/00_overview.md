# SQL tips and tricks

## Overview

This intends to give some nods to useful tips I discovered while writing 
queries for Sparky and reports.

This is not intended to be any kind of complete guide, but is mostly here as a
"hey did you know this exists?" to provide a jumping off point for more 
exploration.

Most of the queries here run at the time of writing against local LMS.
